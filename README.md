# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is part of my **Phase 1: Technical Triple Threat** internship prep. It demonstrates the ability to process unstructured text data and build a deep learning classifier.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Preprocessing:** Tokenization and sequence padding to handle variable-length text.
* **Architecture:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN) featuring an **Embedding Layer** for word vectorization.
* **Regularization:** Successfully combated overfitting using **0.7 Dropout** and **Early Stopping** callbacks.
* **Production Ready:** Includes a saved model file (`.h5`) and a word index dictionary (`.json`) for live inference.

## 📊 Performance
The model achieves balanced performance between training and validation, ensuring it generalizes well to new, unseen reviews rather than just memorizing training data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
